Feel free to increase them.

There is also OBJ supported for export of the map.

- [Half-Life](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/)
- [Counter-Strike](http://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike/)

For creating those maps, I recommend you to use [Valve Hammer Editor](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor) or [Sledge Editor](http://sledge-editor.com/).
